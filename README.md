# Twitter Trend Analysis
Social Media is a wonderful platform for people to share their ideas and sentiments on the topics they are interested in.  With the help of live user tweets, we can analyze the user behavior and preferences across the world. This can help media agencies to target the right demographics to get maximum traffic and gain user satisfaction.

Most of the media websites like YouTube, Pinterest, etc., rely on user interests upon logging in and then entering their favorite contents to garner maximum viewership. YouTube studies the users’ watch history and then recommends other similar videos. However, if these websites do not have a user’s watch history stored, it should still be able to spike the user’s interest by showing the right content.

In my project, I propose to try solve this problem by studying the live tweets posted in Twitter and find out the users’ content preferences based on various factors. These factors include the region in which the user resides, gender, etc. 
For my initial data analysis, I have taken two content types in consideration: Entertainment and Sports. After obtaining many tweets from all states across US, I selected 4 states namely: California, Texas, Ohio and New York and studied the tweet pattern of users from these states using several trending topics in Entertainment and Sports.

In the results of this study, I observed that the users in Texas tweeted the most on the Sports news and those in California tweeted the most related to Entertainment.  With the plot I generated, it could be inferred that users from Texas are more interested in Sports and would likely be more attracted towards sports related content or advertising. These results can be further analyzed using an increased number of tweets and expanding this study to all the 50 states and further media types.
On successful completion of this project, the media industries can observe the user preferences across various demographics and thereby target their content to the users effectively.
